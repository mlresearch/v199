title: A Theory for Knowledge Transfer in Continual Learning
abstract: Continual learning of a stream of tasks is an active area in deep neural
  networks. The main challenge investigated has been the phenomenon of catastrophic
  forgetting or interference of newly acquired knowledge with knowledge from previous
  tasks. Recent work has investigated forward knowledge transfer to new tasks. Backward
  transfer for improving knowledge gained during previous tasks has received much
  less attention. There is in general limited understanding of how knowledge transfer
  could aid tasks learned continually. We present a theory for knowledge transfer
  in continual supervised learning, which considers both forward and backward transfer.
  We aim at understanding their impact for increasingly knowledgeable learners. We
  derive error bounds for each of these transfer mechanisms. These bounds are agnostic
  to specific implementations (e.g. deep neural networks). We demonstrate that, for
  a continual learner that observes related tasks, both forward and backward transfer
  can contribute to an increasing performance as more tasks are observed.
